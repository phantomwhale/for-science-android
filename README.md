# For Science - android app.

The now open-sourced version of the "For Science" Android app

## How to install

To get this working locally, you need to install the [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/) game engine. You may also need to install [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as well, although this might be done as part of the Solar2D install.

On MacOS, I did this via `brew install --cask solar2d`

Then download or clone this repository, and double-click on the main.lua file; this should launch the app in an Android emulator

Beyond this... I'm not an Android dev, but I'm sure building the APK via the Solar2D tools is probably quite easy. Pull requests to update this documentation are welcomed!

## Background

Read about the current state of the android app [on this BGG message thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3133200/android-app-out-of-date)

I thought I'd put the files up on Github as otherwise I'd lose them; happy for this to be the "official" repository for this app, however I don't have any plans to maintain or change the app at present. This is just to preserve the files here.
